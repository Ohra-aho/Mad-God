An Asset folder of a Unity game. Somethig akin to a JRPG. Player is a survivor in a world gone mad. Wierd monsters, horrific sites and so on.
There is still very little of an actual game here, but movement, enemy path finding and simple behaviour has been implemented alongside of a looting system and a base for a combat system.
